The Multipurpose Interface Board (MIB238 board) is a redesign of the Micro Innovations MIB3 board that only requires 5 volts using modern MAX238 transceivers.  The MIB238, like the MIB3, adds a BOOT PROM socket, two RS-232 ports, a parallel port, and a memory expansion board addressor port to your ADAM computer.
