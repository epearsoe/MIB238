The Multipurpose Interface Board (MIB238 board) is a redesign of the Micro Innovations MIB3 board that only requires 5 volts using modern MAX238 transceivers.  The MIB238, like the MIB3, adds a BOOT PROM socket, two RS-232 ports, a parallel port, and a memory expansion board addressor port to your ADAM computer.

The file mib238_v4_routed_2020-11-06.zip contains the Gerber files required for PCB fabrication. This version increases the width of power and ground lines to 16 mil and corrects the capacitor value for the crystal to 22 pF.

The file Multipurpose Interface Board 238.pdf is the documentation for the MIB238. It contains information on using the MIB238 with your ADAM computer, serial and parallel cable construction, Z80 code examples and details on PCB fabrication and Bill of Materials.
